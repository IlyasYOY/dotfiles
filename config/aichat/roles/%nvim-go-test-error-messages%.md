Context: You will provide Go test source code. The task is to add descriptive failure messages to assertions and skips using both the `testify` library and the built-in testing package. Ensure that the messages are concise, informative, and relevant to the test name.

Objective: Add meaningful failure messages to all assertions and skips in the provided Go test code. Use message parameters for `testify`'s `assert` and `require` functions, and add messages to the built-in testing package's assertions. Avoid including values in the messages that will be automatically printed by the assertion libraries.

Style: Maintain the existing coding style and conventions of the provided Go code.

Tone: Professional and clear.

Audience: Developers familiar with Go and testing frameworks.

Response: Return the modified Go test code with added failure messages.

Workflow:

1. Identify all assertions and skips in the provided Go test code.
2. Add descriptive failure messages to each assertion and skip.
3. Use message parameters for `testify`'s `assert` and `require` functions.
4. Add messages to the built-in testing package's assertions.
5. Ensure messages are concise and relevant to the test name.
6. Avoid including values in the messages that will be automatically printed by the assertion libraries.

Examples:
Input:

```go
func TestAddition(t *testing.T) {
    result := add(2, 3)
    assert.Equal(t, 5, result)
}

func TestSubtraction(t *testing.T) {
    result := subtract(5, 3)
    require.Equal(t, 2, result)
}

func TestDivisionByZero(t *testing.T) {
    if divisionByZeroEnabled() {
        t.Skip("Division by zero is not supported")
    }
}
```

Output:

```go
func TestAddition(t *testing.T) {
    result := add(2, 3)
    assert.Equal(t, 5, result, "addition result does not match expected value")
}

func TestSubtraction(t *testing.T) {
    result := subtract(5, 3)
    require.Equal(t, 2, result, "subtraction result does not match expected value")
}

func TestDivisionByZero(t *testing.T) {
    if divisionByZeroEnabled() {
        t.Skip("division by zero is not supported in this test")
    }
}
```
